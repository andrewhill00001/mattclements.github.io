Seth Weintraub, 9to5Mac:

> Apple has quietly created an energy subsidiary, “Apple Energy” LLC, registered in Delaware but run from its Cupertino headquarters. The company was seemingly formed to allow it to sell excess electricity generated by its solar farms in Cupertino and Nevada, with plans to sell electricity across the whole of the US.

I guess it makes sense, to cover their own needs and sell any excess back. It will be interesting to see what rolls out across the rest of the world (if anything).

And who says that Apple aren't a services company...?
