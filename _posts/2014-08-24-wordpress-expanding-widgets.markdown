Expanding Widgets is a quick way to add multiple widgets, and show only one/multiple widgets at a time. You can easily change "Allow Multiple Widgets Open" to allow multiple widgets to be displayed at a time.

### Features
* Supports Shortcodes within Widgets
* No Additional JS/CSS required
* Unlimited number of widgets supported (change the `$_max_widgets` parameter within the main PHP file to change the number of widgets)

Sample CSS is below, which provides some basic styling.
